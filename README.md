# KC Mod Bot
The KC Moderation bot for our community Discord server!

A `config.json` file is required for the bot to run, and for it to use a database.


# Config.json
A `config.json` file is required for the bot to run. Replace the values in `template-config.json` with your own, and rename it to `config.json`.

# Running The Bot
Using a command line, `cd` to the location of the bots files. Run `npm i`, this will install all of its dependencies. Then run the bot with either `npm run dev` or `npm start`, using the dev script will force the bot to restart when its files are changed.
